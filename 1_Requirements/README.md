## Introduction

Nowadays, banking system has been more accessible than ever to perform essential duties e.g online transfer, change account information without having the need to visit nearby bank and perform all of them through online. While the online access to banking functionality for users has given great flexibility but it requires sufficient security provided by the banking company to help protect from unauthorized access to user's accounts and also help the user to perform his activity securely maintaining the privacy. The objective of this project is to design such banking application securely according to design guidelines set in the course and as well perform security testing to expose the vulnerabilities. In following sections, users of the system and their functionality is presented. Application functionality and security aspect of the system are discussed in later sections.

## Objective 

The main objective of this project to perform a banking system application using c programming language used to deposit and debit the amount from your account and we can also check the balance only for existing user and the new user can create an bank account by signing up.



## Features



### Core Banking Functionality for each Internal user

Debit and Credit Funds: Using this feature external user will be able to deposit and withdraw money from their own account.


Transfer Fund: With this functionality implemented, any external user can securely transfer funds within his different types of accounts or from his account to another user’s account. Once a transfer fund transaction is initiated by an external user above critical transaction amount, a regular employee can approve or decline the request based on the account’s funds availability. If the request is granted the end users account is updated accordingly.


Payments: An individual external user can make payments to a merchandise (also a customer of the bank). Once an end user initiates the request to pay to a merchandise, the

request is forwarded to the bank, and after proper authorization from internal bank employee the payment is reflected in both individual user and merchant’s account.


Banking statements: This feature will ensure that an external user will be able to v his/her banking statements.


### Banking Services Access to Employees

Technical Account Access: Through this interface, an internal employee with proper privileges from the system administrator will be able to access external users’ account in order to perform any maintenance requests raised by end users.


Transactions Access: This feature emphasizes that, once any transaction request (Debit/Credit/Funds transfer/Make Payments) has been raised by an end user internal users with proper privileges will be able to approve or decline those requests. The critical transactions requests will directly go to the system manager’s queue.

## Defining Our System

This mini project is to develop a software program for managing the entire bank process related to administration accounts,  customer accounts and to keep each and every track about their property and their various transaction processes efficiently. The record of the customer can be added, updated, searched and deleted. The source code for this project is build in using c programming language and it is short and has been presented in a very understandable manner.
